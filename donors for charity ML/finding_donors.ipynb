    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression\n",
    "•\tDescribe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "Logistic Regression can be used to classify and predict that parts on a production line will be within specification (or not).\n",
    "•\tWhat are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "Strengths of Logistic Regression.\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a Classification model which is simple and allows for low variance.  Another strength of this model is that probabilities are provided for outcomes rather than a Boolean classification. It performs well when the data is linear and seperable.\n",
    "•\tWhat are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "Weaknesses of Logistic Regression.\n",
    "Logistic Regression suffers from high bias and may be too simple for the dataset to be classified. The model performs poorly especially in the case of non-diagonal feature / decision boundaries or non-linear cases without transformation of the data.\n",
    "•\tWhat makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "The Naïve predictor gives an accuracy and F0.5 score of ~25% and the income data has separation so this is a simple model that can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees\n",
    "•\tDescribe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "Marketing: preference profiling of an online customer based on attributes and preferences they have provided (“likes”, favourite colour, age, gender)\n",
    "•\tWhat are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "Decision tree classifiers are able to classify data which is not linearly seperable which is a strength of this model.  Another strength is that for short traversal down the tree it is easy to interpret/visualise the classification. Can trade off accuracy with performance by truncating the number of nodes in the decision tree which would help with early analysis of the data.\n",
    "•\tWhat are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "When the classes contain impurity, ie. There are traces of one class division in another class the model performs poorly. Where there is low information gain / entropy the model will perform poorly.  Decision Tree Classifiers are prone to overfitting.\n",
    "•\tWhat makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "The data is separable so it is likely a decision tree classifier will perform effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "•\tDescribe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "    real-time track analysis (line-following robot)\n",
    "•\tWhat are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "    The Naive Bayes Classifier is easy to implement and is computationally fast.\n",
    "•\tWhat are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "        weakness - high bias and low variance.\n",
    "        In the case where there is no training set observation of a particular category, the probability will be zero for any prediction of that category, the so-called \"Zero Frequency\" Issue.\n",
    "        Correlated features can lead to over-inflation of the importance and should be removed.\n",
    "            Making the assumption of independent variables - for the dataset it could be an incorrect assumption eg. the probability that you like The Steelers and live in Pittsburgh may not be independent.\n",
    "•\tWhat makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "There are a large number of variables and small dataset which is suitable for Naive Bayes.\n",

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",

Classification in this context means the ability for the algorithm to make grouping predictions on new data by learning from existing data (training set).  The algorithm seperates the data into different groups, categories or clusters.  In this case we are training the algorithm to predict a person's income based on information about them such as Age, Occupation, etc.\n",

The algorithm (Logistic Regression) then divides up the data in hyperdimensional space into distinct regions. Hyper-dimensional space sounds futuristic, but this just means that when there are lots of variables then more axes are required to graph the data.  \n",

    "The model creates a decision boundary which is a set of lines - in the simple case a single line above which the model classifies into class 1 and below this class 2. We then use a non-linear function \"cost function\" in the model to minimise the error between the model and the the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
